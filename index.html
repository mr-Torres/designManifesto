    <!--interactivity-->
    <!--<p>Your website should be as interactive as is necessary. Interactivity allows the page to seem interesting while simultaneously allowing the user to easily navigate the different elements on your page. It is essential to couple your interactivity with the themes and motifs of your page and its general feel.</p>-->
    <!--Aesthetics-->
    <!--<p>Your website should be aesthetically pleasing. I am of the opinion that a minimalist approach is the best method to highlight both the beauty and the functionality of your page. The more pleasing to the eye and the easier it is to interact with the page, the more receptive the user is to what you have to offer (and they may visit more often!). It is in the aesthetics that we focus on the use of whitespace, the texture of the font, the impact of the colors and the choices we make around the images and other media we display.</p>-->
    <!--User Interface-->
    <!--<p>All of these elements previously noted must function synergistically in order to produce an experience for the user that is efficient, pleasurable, and alluring. This is what all your work essentially is building up to. You want to ensure that your users' experiences on your page meet a particular need, but in a manner that is engaging and free of distractions or confusion.</p>-->
    <!--Maintenance-->
    <!--<p>The final design principle that must be taken into account, but is often ignored especially by the solo designer is: maintenance. In order to avoid sacrificing the allure of your site, or hindering its interactivity, or worse—making it a generally unpleasureable experience, the designer must ensure that links are functional, that displaying on different screen sizes remains effective, and that the over all style and functionality are aligned with the purpose of the site. </p>-->
